## üéì LESSONS LEARNED

### **What Went Wrong:**
1. Secrets committed to version control
2. Client-side authentication implementation
3. No code review process for security
4. Lack of environment variable usage
5. Massive code duplication (41 files)
6. No security testing before deployment

### **How to Prevent in Future:**
1. Use `.env` files (never commit)
