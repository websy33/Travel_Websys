## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **This audit represents a point-in-time assessment.** New vulnerabilities may be introduced with code changes.

2. **Immediate action is required.** The exposed API keys create real financial and security risks.

3. **Implementation will take time.** Allocate 2-4 weeks for complete security overhaul.

4. **Testing is critical.** Test all changes thoroughly in development before production deployment.

5. **Security is ongoing.** Establish regular security audits and monitoring after fixes.

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Right now, do these 3 things:**

1. **Read** EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md (15 minutes)
2. **Start** 24-hour emergency actions (1 hour)
3. **Plan** implementation with your team (30 minutes)

**Don't delay** - exposed API keys are actively at risk!
