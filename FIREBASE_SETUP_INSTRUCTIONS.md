# Firebase Setup Instructions

## Issue Fixed
The white screen was caused by missing Firebase environment variables, which caused the app to crash during initialization.

## What Was Fixed
1. ✅ **Fixed undefined component** in `src/App.jsx` - replaced `<Holidays />` with `<HolidayPackages />`
2. ✅ **Added defensive Firebase initialization** in `src/firebase.js` - prevents crashes when credentials are missing
3. ✅ **Updated AuthContext** in `src/auth/AuthContext.jsx` - handles missing Firebase gracefully
4. ✅ **Added ErrorBoundary** - catches and displays runtime errors instead of white screen

## Current Status
The app should now load without a white screen. However, **Firebase authentication features will be disabled** until you add Firebase credentials.

## To Enable Firebase Authentication (Optional)

### Step 1: Get Firebase Credentials
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Create a new project or select existing project
3. Go to Project Settings (gear icon) > General
4. Scroll to "Your apps" section
5. Click "Web app" or add a new web app
6. Copy the Firebase configuration values

### Step 2: Add to .env File
Open your `.env` file (in the project root) and add these lines:

```env
# Firebase Configuration (for authentication features)
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### Step 3: Enable Google Authentication (if needed)
1. In Firebase Console, go to Authentication > Sign-in method
2. Enable Google as a sign-in provider
3. Add authorized domains (localhost, your production domain)

### Step 4: Restart Development Server
After adding credentials:
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

## Testing
- **Without Firebase**: App will load normally, but login features will show warnings in console
- **With Firebase**: Full authentication functionality will be available

## Console Warnings (Expected)
If Firebase is not configured, you'll see this warning in browser console:
```
Firebase credentials not configured. Authentication features will be disabled.
```

This is normal and the app will work fine without it (authentication features just won't be available).

## Need Help?
- White screen persists? Check browser DevTools Console (F12) for error messages
- Firebase errors? Verify all credentials are correct and match your Firebase project
